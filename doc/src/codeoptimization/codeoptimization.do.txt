=====     Optimization and profiling =====
!bblock


Till now we have not paid much attention to speed and possible optimization possibilities
inherent in the various compilers. We have compiled and linked as
!bc cppcod
c++  -c  mycode.cpp
c++  -o  mycode.exe  mycode.o
!ec
For Fortran replace with for example _gfortran_ or _ifort_.
This is what we call a flat compiler option and should be used when we develop the code.
It produces normally a very large and slow code when translated to machine instructions.
We use this option for debugging and for establishing the correct program output because
every operation is done precisely as the user specified it.

It is instructive to look up the compiler manual for further instructions by writing
!bc cppcod
man c++
!ec

!eblock
!split
===== More on optimization =====
!bblock
We have additional compiler options for optimization. These may include procedure inlining where 
performance may be improved, moving constants inside loops outside the loop, 
identify potential parallelism, include automatic vectorization or replace a division with a reciprocal
and a multiplication if this speeds up the code.
!bc cppcod
c++  -O3 -c  mycode.cpp
c++  -O3 -o  mycode.exe  mycode.o
!ec
This (other options are -O2 or -Ofast) is the recommended option. 


!eblock
!split
=====    Optimization and profiling  =====
!bblock
It is also useful to profile your program under the development stage.
You would then compile with 
!bc cppcod
c++  -pg -O3 -c  mycode.cpp
c++  -pg -O3 -o  mycode.exe  mycode.o
!ec
After you have run the code you can obtain the profiling information via
!bc cppcod
gprof mycode.exe >  ProfileOutput
!ec
When you have profiled properly your code, you must take out this option as it 
slows down performance.
For memory tests use "valgrind":"http://www.valgrind.org". An excellent environment for all these aspects, and much  more, is  Qt creator.

!eblock

!split
=====    Optimization and debugging  =====
!bblock
Adding debugging options is a very useful alternative under the development stage of a program.
You would then compile with 
!bc cppcod
c++  -g -O0 -c  mycode.cpp
c++  -g -O0 -o  mycode.exe  mycode.o
!ec
This option generates debugging information allowing you to trace for example if an array is properly allocated. Some compilers work best with the no optimization option _-O0_. 
!eblock
!bblock Other optimization flags 
Depending on the compiler, one can add flags which generate code that catches integer overflow errors. 
The flag _-ftrapv_ does this for the CLANG compiler on OS X operating systems.   
!eblock



!split
=====    Other hints  =====
!bblock
In general, irrespective of compiler options, it is useful to
* avoid if tests or call to functions inside loops, if possible. 
* avoid multiplication with constants inside loops if possible
Here is an example of a part of a program where specific operations lead to a slower code
!bc cppcod
k = n-1;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++){
    a[i] = b[i] +c*d;
    e = g[k];
}
!ec
A better code is
!bc cppcod
temp = c*d;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++){
    a[i] = b[i] + temp;
}
e = g[n-1];
!ec
Here we avoid a repeated multiplication inside a loop. 
Most compilers, depending on compiler flags, identify and optimize such bottlenecks on their own, without requiring any particular action by the programmer. However, it is always useful to single out and avoid code examples like the first one discussed here.

!split
===== Vectorization and the basic idea behind parallel computing =====
!bblock
Present CPUs are highly parallel processors with varying levels of parallelism. The typical situation can be described via the following three statements.
* Pursuit of shorter computation time and larger simulation size gives rise to parallel computing.
* Multiple processors are involved to solve a global problem.
* The essence is to divide the entire computation evenly among collaborative processors.  Divide and conquer.

Before we proceed with a more detailed discussion of topics like vectorization and parallelization, we need to remind ourselves about some basic features of different hardware models. 

!eblock

!split
===== A rough classification of hardware models  =====
!bblock

* Conventional single-processor computers are named SISD (single-instruction-single-data) machines.
* SIMD (single-instruction-multiple-data) machines incorporate the idea of parallel processing, using a large number of processing units to execute the same instruction on different data.
* Modern parallel computers are so-called MIMD (multiple-instruction-multiple-data) machines and can execute different instruction streams in parallel on different data.


!eblock
!split
=====  Shared memory and distributed memory =====
!bblock
One way of categorizing modern parallel computers is to look at the memory configuration.
* In shared memory systems the CPUs share the same address space. Any CPU can access any data in the global memory.
* In distributed memory systems each CPU has its own memory.

The CPUs are connected by some network and may exchange messages.

!eblock

!split
=====    Different parallel programming paradigms  =====
!bblock

* _Task parallelism_:  the work of a global problem can be divided into a number of independent tasks, which rarely need to synchronize.  Monte Carlo simulations represent a typical situation. Integration is another. However this paradigm is of limited use.
* _Data parallelism_:  use of multiple threads (e.g. one or more threads per processor) to dissect loops over arrays etc.  Communication and synchronization between processors are often hidden, thus easy to program. However, the user surrenders much control to a specialized compiler. Examples of data parallelism are compiler-based parallelization and OpenMP directives. 

!eblock
!split
=====    Different parallel programming paradigms =====
!bblock

* _Message passing_:  all involved processors have an independent memory address space. The user is responsible for  partitioning the data/work of a global problem and distributing the  subproblems to the processors. Collaboration between processors is achieved by explicit message passing, which is used for data transfer plus synchronization.

* This paradigm is the most general one where the user has full control. Better parallel efficiency is usually achieved by explicit message passing. However, message-passing programming is more difficult.

!split 
===== What is vectorization? ===== 
Vectorization is a special
case of _Single Instructions Multiple Data_ (SIMD) to denote a single
instruction stream capable of operating on multiple data elements in
parallel. 
We can think of vectorization as the unrolling of loops accompanied with SIMD instructions.

Vectorization is the process of converting an algorithm that performs scalar operations
(typically one operation at the time) to vector operations where a single operation can refer to many simultaneous operations.
Consider the following example
!bc cppcod
for (i = 0; i < n; i++){
    a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
}
!ec
If the code is not vectorized, the compiler will simply start with the first element and 
then perform subsequent additions operating on one address in memory at the time. 

!split 
===== Number of elements that can acted upon =====
A SIMD instruction can operate  on multiple data elements in one single instruction.
It uses the so-called 128-bit SIMD floating-point register. 
In this sense,vectorization adds some form of parallelism since one instruction is applied  
to many parts of say a vector.

The number of elements which can be operated on in parallel
range from four single-precision floating point data elements in so-called 
Streaming SIMD Extensions and two double-precision floating-point data
elements in Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 to sixteen byte operations in
a 128-bit register in Streaming SIMD Extensions 2. Thus, vector-length
ranges from 2 to 16, depending on the instruction extensions used and
on the data type. 

!split 
===== Number of elements that can acted upon, examples =====
We start with the simple scalar operations given by
!bc cppcod
for (i = 0; i < n; i++){
    a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
}
!ec
If the code is not vectorized  and we have a 128-bit register to store a 32 bits floating point number,
it means that we have $3\times 32$ bits that are not used. For the first element we have


|-------------------------------|
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3                 | 
|-------------------------------|
| a[0]= | not used | not used| not used|
|-------------------------------|
| b[0]+ | not used | not used| not used|
|-------------------------------|
| c[0] | not used | not used| not used|
|-------------------------------|

We have thus unused space in our SIMD registers. These registers could hold three additional integers.



!split 
===== Number of elements that can acted upon, examples =====
If we vectorize the code, we can perform, with a 128-bit register four simultaneous operations, that is
we have
!bc cppcod
for (i = 0; i < n; i+=4){
    a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
    a[i+1] = b[i+1] + c[i+1];
    a[i+2] = b[i+2] + c[i+2];
    a[i+3] = b[i+3] + c[i+3];
}
!ec
displayed here as

|-------------------------------|
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3                 | 
|-------------------------------|
|  a[0]= | a[1]= | a[2]=| a[3]= |
|-------------------------------|
|  b[0]+ | b[1]+ | b[2]+| b[3]+ |
|-------------------------------|
| c[0]| c[1] | c[2] | c[3]      | 
|-------------------------------|
Four additions are now done in a single step.

!split
===== "A simple test case with and without vectorization":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/blob/master/doc/Programs/LecturePrograms/programs/Classes/cpp/program7.cpp" =====
We implement these operations in a simple c++ program as 

!bc cppcode
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <iomanip>
#include "time.h" 

using namespace std; // note use of namespace                                       
int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
  int i = atoi(argv[1]); 
  double *a, *b, *c;
  a = new double[i]; 
  b = new double[i]; 
  c = new double[i]; 
  for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
    a[j] = 0.0;
    b[j] = cos(j*1.0);
    c[j] = sin(j*3.0);
  }
  clock_t start, finish;
  start = clock();
  for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
    a[j] = b[j]+b[j]*c[j];
  }
  finish = clock();
  double timeused = (double) (finish - start)/(CLOCKS_PER_SEC );
  cout << setiosflags(ios::showpoint | ios::uppercase);
  cout << setprecision(10) << setw(20) << "Time used  for vector addition and multiplication=" << timeused  << endl;
  delete [] a;
  delete [] b;
  delete [] c;
  return 0;     
}
!ec


!split 
===== Compiling with and without vectorization =====
We can compile and link without vectorization
!bc cppcod
c++ -o novec.x vecexample.cpp
!ec
and with vectorization (and additional optimizations)
!bc cppcod
c++ -O3 -o  vec.x vecexample.cpp 
!ec
The speedup depends on the size of the vectors. In the example here we have run with $10^7$ elements.
The example here was run on a PC with ubuntu 14.04 as operating system and an Intel i7-4790 CPU running at 3.60 GHz. 
!bc cppcod 
Compphys:~ hjensen$ ./vec.x 10000000
Time used  for vector addition = 0.0100000
Compphys:~ hjensen$ ./novec.x 10000000
Time used  for vector addition = 0.03000000000
!ec
This particular C++ compiler speeds up the above loop operations with a factor of 3. 
Performing the same operations for $10^8$ elements results only in a factor $1.4$.
The result will however vary from compiler to compiler. In general however, with optimization flags like $-O3$ or $-Ofast$, we gain a considerable speedup if our code can be vectorized. Many of these operations can be done automatically by your compiler. These automatic or near automatic compiler techniques improve performance considerably. 

!split
=====  Automatic vectorization and vectorization inhibitors, criteria =====

Not all loops can be vectorized, as discussed in "Intel's guide to vectorization":"https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/a-guide-to-auto-vectorization-with-intel-c-compilers"

An important criteria is that the loop counter $n$ is known at the entry of the loop.
!bc cppcod
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    a[j] = cos(j*1.0);
  }
!ec
The variable $n$ does need to be known at compile time. However, this variable must stay the same for the entire duration of the loop. It implies that an exit statement inside the loop cannot be data dependent.

!split
=====  Automatic vectorization and vectorization inhibitors, exit criteria =====

An exit statement should in general be avoided. 
If the exit statement contains data-dependent conditions, the loop cannot be vectorized. 
The following is an example of a non-vectorizable loop
!bc cppcod
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    a[j] = cos(j*1.0);
    if (a[j] < 0 ) break;
  }
!ec
Avoid loop termination conditions and opt for a single entry loop variable $n$. The lower and upper bounds have to be kept fixed within the loop. 
!split
=====  Automatic vectorization and vectorization inhibitors, straight-line code =====
SIMD instructions perform the same type of operations multiple times. 
A _switch_ statement leads thus to a non-vectorizable loop since different statemens cannot branch.
The following code can however be vectorized since the _if_ statement is implemented as a masked assignment.
!bc cppcod
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    double x  = cos(j*1.0);
    if (x > 0 ) {
       a[j] =  x*sin(j*2.0); 
    }
    else {
       a[j] = 0.0;
    }
  }
!ec
These operations can be performed for all data elements but only those elements which the mask evaluates as true are stored. In general, one should avoid branches such as _switch_, _go to_, or _return_ statements or _if_ constructs that cannot be treated as masked assignments. 


!split
=====  Automatic vectorization and vectorization inhibitors, nested loops =====

Only the innermost loop of the following example is vectorized
!bc cppcod
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
           a[i][j] += b[i][j];
      }  
  }
!ec
The exception is if an original outer loop is transformed into an inner loop as the result of compiler optimizations.


!split
=====  Automatic vectorization and vectorization inhibitors, function calls =====

Calls to programmer defined functions ruin vectorization. However, calls to intrinsic functions like
$\sin{x}$, $\cos{x}$, $\exp{x}$ etc are allowed since they are normally efficiently vectorized. 
The following example is fully vectorizable
!bc cppcod
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      a[i] = log10(i)*cos(i);
  }
!ec
Similarly, _inline_ functions defined by the programmer, allow for vectorization since the function statements are glued into the actual place where the function is called. 


!split
=====  Automatic vectorization and vectorization inhibitors, data dependencies =====

One has to keep in mind that vectorization changes the order of operations inside a loop. A so-called
read-after-write statement with an explicit flow dependency cannot be vectorized. The following code
!bc cppcod
  double b = 15.;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      a[i] = a[i-1] + b;
  }
!ec
is an example of flow dependency and results in wrong numerical results if vectorized. For a scalar operation, the value $a[i-1]$ computed during the iteration is loaded into the right-hand side and the results are fine. In vector mode however, with a vector length of four, the values $a[0]$, $a[1]$, $a[2]$ and $a[3]$ from the previous loop will be loaded into the right-hand side and produce wrong results. That is, we have
!bc cppcod
   a[1] = a[0] + b;
   a[2] = a[1] + b;
   a[3] = a[2] + b;
   a[4] = a[3] + b;
!ec
and if the two first iterations are  executed at the same by the SIMD instruction, the value of say $a[1]$ could be used by the second iteration before it has been calculated by the first iteration, leading thereby to wrong results.

!split
=====  Automatic vectorization and vectorization inhibitors, more data dependencies =====

On the other hand,  a so-called 
write-after-read statement can be vectorized. The following code
!bc cppcod
  double b = 15.;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      a[i-1] = a[i] + b;
  }
!ec
is an example of flow dependency that can be vectorized since no iteration with a higher value of $i$
can complete before an iteration with a lower value of $i$. However, such code leads to problems with parallelization.


!split
=====  Automatic vectorization and vectorization inhibitors, memory stride =====


For C++ programmers  it is also worth keeping in mind that an array notation is preferred to the more compact use of pointers to access array elements. The compiler can often not tell if it is safe to vectorize the code. 

When dealing with arrays, you should also avoid memory stride, since this slows down considerably vectorization. When you access array element, write for example the inner loop to vectorize using unit stride, that is, access successively the next array element in memory, as shown here
!bc cppcod
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
           a[i][j] += b[i][j];
      }  
  }
!ec


!split
=====    Today's situation of parallel computing  =====
!bblock

* Distributed memory is the dominant hardware configuration. There is a large diversity in these machines, from  MPP (massively parallel processing) systems to clusters of off-the-shelf PCs, which are very cost-effective.
* Message-passing is a mature programming paradigm and widely accepted. It often provides an efficient match to the hardware. It is primarily used for the distributed memory systems, but can also be used on shared memory systems.

* Modern nodes have nowadays several cores, which makes it interesting to use both shared memory (the given node) and distributed memory (several nodes with communication). This leads often to codes which use both MPI and OpenMP.

Our lectures will focus on both MPI and OpenMP.

!eblock

!split
=====  Overhead present in parallel computing =====
!bblock

* _Uneven load balance_:  not all the processors can perform useful work at all time.
* _Overhead of synchronization_
* _Overhead of communication_
* _Extra computation due to parallelization_

Due to the above overhead and that certain parts of a sequential
algorithm cannot be parallelized we may not achieve an optimal parallelization.
!eblock


!split
=====    Parallelizing a sequential algorithm  =====
!bblock

* Identify the part(s) of a sequential algorithm that can be  executed in parallel. This is the difficult part,
* Distribute the global work and data among $P$ processors.

!eblock




!split
===== Strategies =====
!bblock
* Develop codes locally, run with some few processes and test your codes.  Do benchmarking, timing and so forth on local nodes, for example your laptop or PC. 
* When you are convinced that your codes run correctly, you can start your production runs on available supercomputers.

!eblock

!split
===== How do I run MPI on a PC/Laptop?  =====
!bblock
The  machines at the computer lab have eight CPUs (look up the file /proc/cpuinfo)
* Compile with mpicxx or mpic++ or mpif90
* Set up collaboration between processes and run 
!bc cppcod
  mpd --ncpus=8 &
  #  run code with
  mpiexec -n 8 ./nameofprog
!ec
Here we declare that we will use 8 CPUs via the *-ncpus* option and via $-n 8$ when running.
!eblock

!split
===== Can I do it on my own PC/laptop? =====
!bblock
At the computer lab, we have installed both OpenMP and MPI. If you wish to install MPI and OpenMP 
on your laptop, we recommend the following:
* For MPI, we recommend that you follow the instructions at the "Open MPI":"www.open-mpi.org/software" website and follow the instructions. OpenMPI is also accessible for easy installation for Ubuntu users via the _synaptic package manager_. 
* For OpenMP, the compile option _-fopenmp_ is included automatically in recent versions of the C++ compiler and Fortran compilers. 
* For OS X users however, use for example 
!bc cppcod
  brew install clang-omp
!ec
!eblock

!split
===== What is Message Passing Interface (MPI)?  =====
!bblock

_MPI_ is a library, not a language. It specifies the names, calling sequences and results of functions
or subroutines to be called from C/C++ or Fortran programs, and the classes and methods that make up the MPI C++
library. The programs that users write in Fortran, C or C++ are compiled with ordinary compilers and linked
with the MPI library.

MPI programs should be able to run
on all possible machines and run all MPI implementetations without change.

An MPI computation is a collection of processes communicating with messages.


!eblock
!split
===== Going Parallel with MPI =====
!bblock
_Task parallelism_: the work of a global problem can be divided
into a number of independent tasks, which rarely need to synchronize. 
Monte Carlo simulations or numerical integration are examples of this.


MPI is a message-passing library where all the routines
have corresponding C/C++-binding
!bc cppcod
   MPI_Command_name
!ec
and Fortran-binding (routine names are in uppercase, but can also be in lower case)
!bc forcod
   MPI_COMMAND_NAME
!ec
!eblock


!split
===== MPI is a library  =====
!bblock
MPI is a library specification for the message passing interface,
proposed as a standard.

* independent of hardware;
* not a language or compiler specification;
* not a specific implementation or product.


A message passing standard for portability and ease-of-use. 
Designed for high performance.

Insert communication and synchronization functions where necessary.


!eblock

=====    Bindings to MPI routines  =====

!split
===== Communicator  =====
!bblock
* A group of MPI processes with a name (context).
* Any process is identified by its rank. The rank is only meaningful within a particular communicator.
* By default the communicator contains all the MPI processes.
!bc cppcod
  MPI_COMM_WORLD 
!ec
* Mechanism to identify subset of processes.
* Promotes modular design of parallel libraries.


!eblock


!split
=====  Some of the most  important MPI functions =====
!bblock



* $MPI\_Init$ - initiate an MPI computation
* $MPI\_Finalize$ - terminate the MPI computation and clean up
* $MPI\_Comm\_size$ - how many processes participate in a given MPI communicator?
* $MPI\_Comm\_rank$ - which one am I? (A number between 0 and size-1.)
* $MPI\_Send$ - send a message to a particular process within an MPI communicator
* $MPI\_Recv$ - receive a message from a particular process within an MPI communicator
* $MPI\_reduce$  or $MPI\_Allreduce$, send and receive messages

!eblock


!split
=====    The first MPI C/C++ program  =====
!bblock


Let every process write "Hello world" (oh not this program again!!) on the standard output. 
!bc cppcod
using namespace std;
#include <mpi.h>
#include <iostream>
int main (int nargs, char* args[])
{
int numprocs, my_rank;
//   MPI initializations
MPI_Init (&nargs, &args);

=====    Note 1  =====
!bblock

* The output to screen is not ordered since all processes are trying to write  to screen simultaneously.
* It is the operating system which opts for an ordering.  
* If we wish to have an organized output, starting from the first process, we may rewrite our program as in the next example.

!eblock

=====    Ordered output with $MPI\_Barrier$  =====
!bblock

!bc cppcod
int main (int nargs, char* args[])
{
 int numprocs, my_rank, i;
 MPI_Init (&nargs, &args);
 MPI_Comm_size (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &numprocs);
 MPI_Comm_rank (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &my_rank);
 for (i = 0; i < numprocs; i++) {}
 MPI_Barrier (MPI_COMM_WORLD);
 if (i == my_rank) {
 cout << "Hello world, I have  rank " << my_rank << 
        " out of " << numprocs << endl;}
      MPI_Finalize ();
!ec

!eblock


!split
=====    Note 2 =====
!bblock
* Here we have used the $MPI\_Barrier$ function to ensure that that every process has completed  its set of instructions in  a particular order.
* A barrier is a special collective operation that does not allow the processes to continue until all processes in the communicator (here $MPI\_COMM\_WORLD$) have called $MPI\_Barrier$. 
* The barriers make sure that all processes have reached the same point in the code. Many of the collective operations like $MPI\_ALLREDUCE$ to be discussed later, have the same property; that is, no process can exit the operation until all processes have started. 

However, this is slightly more time-consuming since the processes synchronize between themselves as many times as there
are processes.  In the next Hello world example we use the send and receive functions in order to a have a synchronized
action.

This single command allows the passing of any kind of variable, even a large array, to any group of tasks. 
The variable _buf_ is the variable we wish to send while _count_
is the  number of variables we are passing. If we are passing only a single value, this should be 1. 

If we transfer an array, it is  the overall size of the array. 
For example, if we want to send a 10 by 10 array, count would be $10\times 10=100$ 
since we are  actually passing 100 values.

=====    Note 4  =====
!bblock

Once you have  sent a message, you must receive it on another task. The function $MPI\_RECV$
is similar to the send call.
!bc cppcod
int MPI_Recv( void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, 
            int source, 
            int tag, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Status *status )
!ec

The arguments that are different from those in MPI\_SEND are
_buf_ which  is the name of the variable where you will  be storing the received data, 
_source_ which  replaces the destination in the send command. This is the return ID of the sender.

Finally,  we have used  $MPI\_Status\_status$,  
where one can check if the receive was completed.

The output of this code is the same as the previous example, but now
process 0 sends a message to process 1, which forwards it further
to process 2, and so forth.

===== How do I use $MPI\_reduce$? =====
!bblock

Here we have used
!bc cppcod
MPI_reduce( void *senddata, void* resultdata, int count, 
     MPI_Datatype datatype, MPI_Op, int root, MPI_Comm comm)
!ec

The two variables $senddata$ and $resultdata$ are obvious, besides the fact that one sends the address
of the variable or the first element of an array.  If they are arrays they need to have the same size. 
The variable $count$ represents the total dimensionality, 1 in case of just one variable, 
while $MPI\_Datatype$ 
defines the type of variable which is sent and received.  

The new feature is $MPI\_Op$. It defines the type
of operation we want to do. 
!eblock

!split
===== More on $MPI\_Reduce$ =====
!bblock
In our case, since we are summing
the rectangle  contributions from every process we define  $MPI\_Op = MPI\_SUM$.
If we have an array or matrix we can search for the largest og smallest element by sending either $MPI\_MAX$ or 
$MPI\_MIN$.  If we want the location as well (which array element) we simply transfer 
$MPI\_MAXLOC$ or $MPI\_MINOC$. If we want the product we write $MPI\_PROD$. 

$MPI\_Allreduce$ is defined as
!bc cppcod     
MPI_Allreduce( void *senddata, void* resultdata, int count, 
          MPI_Datatype datatype, MPI_Op, MPI_Comm comm)

=====    What is OpenMP =====
!bblock
* OpenMP provides high-level thread programming
* Multiple cooperating threads are allowed to run simultaneously
* Threads are created and destroyed dynamically in a fork-join pattern
  *  An OpenMP program consists of a number of parallel regions
  *  Between two parallel regions there is only one master thread
  *  In the beginning of a parallel region, a team of new threads is spawned
  * The newly spawned threads work simultaneously with the master thread
  * At the end of a parallel region, the new threads are destroyed

* OpenMP data scope attribute clauses:
 * _shared_

* define which variables are visible to all threads in a parallel region, and which variables are privately allocated to each thread


!eblock


!split
=====    Some remarks  =====
!bblock

* When entering a parallel region, the _private_ clause ensures each thread having its own new variable instances. The new variables are assumed to be uninitialized.
* A shared variable exists in only one memory location and all threads can read and write to that address. It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that multiple threads properly access a shared variable.
* The _firstprivate_ clause combines the behavior of the private clause with automatic initialization.
* The _lastprivate_ clause combines the behavior of the private clause with a copy back (from the last loop iteration or section) to the original variable outside the parallel region.

* Parallelization
