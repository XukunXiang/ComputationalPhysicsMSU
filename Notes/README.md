## How to use Git(with Github)
I am a novice for Git, but I will try to cover all the basic commands and procedures (**using git on HPCC**) here.

Basicallly just go through the [GitHub Bootcamp](https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/) and you should be ready to go.

I would suggest using the Linux version so that we can make our workflow more efficient.

###Set up Git and GitHub
1. Seting up an account on GitHub(_not sure about this one_)
1. Set up Git with the exact same information(username and email)
1. Authenticating with GitHub from Git
		If you are maining working on HPCC, you should probably choose **Connecting over SSH** 

###Start working:
	1. Developing based on an existing project
		- You need to use ["fork and clone"] (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to get started.
		- When copy the clone URL, please choose *SSH* rather then *HTTPS*
			- It should looks like "git@github.com:XukunXiang/ComputationalPhysicsMSU.git"


	2. Adding your existing project on GitHub to share with others
		- [Adding an existing project to Github](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)
