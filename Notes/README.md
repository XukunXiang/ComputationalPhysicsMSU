## How to use Git(with Github)
I am a novice for Git, but I will try to cover all the basic commands and procedures (**using git on HPCC**) here.

1. Create an an account on Github
	- This should be fairly straight forward on Github.com

2. Setup your global 'user.name' and 'user.email' in HPCC with the same information
	- '<git config --global user.name "_your user name_" >'
	- '<git config --global user.email "_your email_">'


### Some good introductry stuff
There are a ton of great tutorials(short or detailed) out there.
